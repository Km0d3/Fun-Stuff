 **This project is based off of the repository [Python ATM Machine](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/tree/main/BasicPythonScripts/ATM%20Machine%20System)**

 None of the code from the github link above was copied or used on purpose. Just the idea. 

 This was a personal project to better work with python since I am a little rusty.

 This code is beginner level feel free to let me know of any improvements or different things I could have done to better improve my coding or make it more effecient.


**Notes about this project after completion:**
>- I ended up having to create a filter to the deposit and withdraw pages. Without the filter it was possible to trick the system by adding a - in the withdraw field which caused it to actually add to the balance.
>- The Coloring and the loading bar are totally useless but it was an added challenge to figure out and makes everything look more "official" and clean.
>- I was able to turn the last_transaction field of the Account_Info class into an array by making a format of "Deposit 20" and then using the split() function to turn it into something I could format. 

** What could be improved?**
>- The pin is hardcoded could make a sign-up/login system with hashing and decryption. (Added onto that I could create a simulated server so that nothing "sensitive" would be anywhere near possible attackers.)
>- Formatting and Making everything look better.
>- Exception Handling and Bug Testing
